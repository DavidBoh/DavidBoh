### Hi there 👋
🔭 I’m currently working as a Data Analyst using Spreadsheets, SQL, Python, and Zoho Analytics BI
<br>
🌱 I’m currently learning Data Science in Coursera and reading books about Data Science!
<br>
🦀 In my spare time I'm trying to learn Rust, C, and Go. 
<br>
🐧 Linux is my default OS and my favorite OS, followed by MacOS and Windows is okay too, but it is my last choice
